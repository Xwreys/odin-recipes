    <img src="../img/steakg.jpeg"alt="picture of steak">
    <h3>Ingedients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 flank steak</li>
        <li>butcher's twine</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 bunch baby spinach</li>
        <li>¼ cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>2 strips cooked crispy bacon (Optional)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a charcoal griller (such as Big Green Egg®) to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Lay flank steak on a flat work surface. Cut steak from one side through the middle horizontally to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book.</li>
        <li>Arrange butcher's twine on a plate, enough to cover the length of the steak. Place each string about 1 inch apart. Place steak on top; season with salt and pepper. Lay down a thick bed of spinach on top. Scatter feta cheese, olives, and bacon over the spinach.</li>
        <li>Roll steak up starting from the edge closest to you, pressing filling down to tighten the roll. Tie with butcher's twine.</li>
        <li>Cook over direct heat, turning at least once, until steak is beginning to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, 6 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
